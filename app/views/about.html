I have a year of self-taught experience coding in JavaScript and over 20 years of experience in programming fundamentals.  I also possess a high understanding of HTML and CSS based on years of working on personal websites.  I am interested in exploring Front End Development opportunites within the Triad and Durham, NC areas.  I feel with my experiences and background, I would be a quick and useful learner, and a great addition to a challenging web development team.
