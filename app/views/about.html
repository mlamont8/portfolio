                 <p class="lead">My name is Lamont Taylor and I am a Junior Front End Web Developer living near the Triad/Triangle NC.  I have a year of self-taught experience coding in JavaScript, project experience in Angularjs and over 20 years of experience in programming fundamentals.  I also possess a high understanding of HTML and CSS based on years of working on personal websites.  I am interested in exploring Front End Development opportunites within the Triad and Durham, NC areas.  I feel with my experiences and background, I would be a quick and useful learner, and a great addition to a challenging web development team.
