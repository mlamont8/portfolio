                  <p>Hi Again!</p>
                 <p> My name is Lamont Taylor and I am a Front End Web Developer living in Greensboro, NC.  </p>

                 <p>I have been working on websites part-time for over 20 years since my experiences in college.  </p>

                 <p>Over a year ago, I decided to teach myself JavaScript and eventually AngularJS to add to the HTML and CSS skills I already possessed.                            
                </p>
                <p>I am always working to improve my skills in JavasScript, AngularJS and other technologies.</p>
             
        </div>
        <!-- Third Row -->
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>Currently I am also starting to learn backend technolgies such as NodeJS to become full stack. I do not anticipate a problem, although I am self taught, I have a good background in coding languages including C++ and programming principles from college.</p>
          <p> At the present time, I am interested in exploring Front End Development opportunites within the Triad to the Durham, NC areas.  Feel free to scroll down for more.</p>
